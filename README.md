# striders shoes site

**the teal design firm worked on this site for ACAD-275, a course at USC's iovine and young academy.**
welcome! our mission is to revolutionize the way you interact with your footwear through innovative customization. dive into a world where your shoes are not just an accessory, but a canvas for your personal expression.

this site was made by the striders team for the acad-275 course at usc's iovine and young academy. through the course, we learned to use html, css, javascript, and jquery to create a website.

visit the site here: https://medler.webdev.iyaserver.com/acad275/Striders/main-page.html

## skills learned and used

- responsive design for device sizes and layouts
- motion graphics
- animation sequences
- interactive photo galleries
- interactive JavaScript chart (find this on the "why striders" page! tristan created a pro forma spreadsheet, and mei utilized chart.js to display the relationship between total expenses and net profits.)
- major and medium scripting routines

## introduction

the striders team project is part of the acad 275 course, focusing on building content that stands out. our project allows users to customize their shoes with a wide range of charms and accessories, making each pair unique and personal.

striders shoes is a project architected by lukas ross, a BFA student at USC's roski school of art and design. ross paired up with the course to create an assignment for us to exercise the knowledge we learned in class! we've formatted the site to reflect the arts of design and visual communication, the introductory technology of coding, scripting, and animation, and the business of startup finances and team management.

## features

- **collections page**: choose from hundreds of charms to add a personal touch to your footwear!
- **interactive design tool**: use our web-based tool to visualize your customizations in real-time.
- **visual design**: ashley, sinchana and mari used CSS to create the visual design for the website, based on the customer.
