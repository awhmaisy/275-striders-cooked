## introduction

the striders team project is part of the acad 275 course, focusing on building content that stands out. our project allows users to customize their shoes with a wide range of charms and accessories, making each pair unique and personal.

striders shoes is a project architected by lukas ross, a BFA student at USC's roski school of art and design. ross paired up with the course to create an assignment for us to exercise the knowledge we learned in class! we've formatted the site to reflect the arts of design and visual communication, the introductory technology of coding, scripting, and animation, and the business of startup finances and team management.

## features
