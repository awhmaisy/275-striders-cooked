            <section id="about-striders">
                <p>Striders revolutionizes shoe customization by introducing versatile charms that can attach to any
                    type of shoe, breaking away from the limitations set by traditional options like Crocs' Jibbitz.
                    While Jibbitz allowed for personalization, their application was restricted to just the Croc and the
                    front toe box area only. Striders expands on this concept by offering the freedom to attach charms
                    anywhere on your footwear, allowing for a personal touch. With
                    Striders, every pair of shoes becomes a canvas for self-expression, allowing individuals to
                    transform their footwear into something extremely unique.</p>
